      For people over 60 or people who get a disability-based benefit, Michigan allows deductions for out-of-pocket medical expenses that are more than $35/month. Put your total monthly out-of-pocket medical expenses and we’ll calculate what deduction you’re eligible for. 

      ${ collapse_template(medical_expenses_help) }

      The standard medical deduction is $165 for expenses over $35. If you have actual medical expenses that are more than $165, you can deduct the entire expense, minus $35, if you can verify the expenses.

  What types of unearned income should **not** be included?
content: |
  The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) does not count certain types of unearned income when figuring out your Food Stamps. If you or anyone in your household has any of the following kinds of income, **DO NOT** include that income.

  **Educational Income** MDHHS will not count any educational income, including scholarships, grants, loans, work-study, assistanceships and fellowships. If you or anyone in your household receives income that goes directly to pay for your education, such as scholarship money, a student loan or other educational income, **DO NOT** count any of the income.

  **Income of Legal Immigrants** If someone in your household is a **legal** immigrant who is **not allowed** to receive Food Stamps, **DO NOT** count any unearned income of that person or persons.

  **EXCEPTION**: You must count all cash assistance (FIP) income in the next step, even if it is received by someone in your household who is a legal immigrant.

  **The MDHHS $50 "Child Support Pass-Through"**- If you or someone in your household receives cash assistance (FIP), MDHHS usually returns up to $50 per month of the child support that they collect. If you or someone in your household receives this "Child Support Pass Through", **DO NOT** count that income.

  **Child Support Refunds and Reimbursements** Sometimes the Friend of the Court accidentally sends child support payments to MDHHS instead of to the custodial parent. Other times, Friend of the Court will send too much child support to MDHHS. When either of these situations happen MDHHS must return the child support payment to the custodial parent. If you or someone in your household has received a child support "refund" from MDHHS, **DO NOT** count that income.
